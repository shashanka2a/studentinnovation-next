    initialMessage: "ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm your AI consultant and I'm thrilled to help you bring your vision to life! I've reviewed your project details and I can already see the potential in what you're building. Let's dive deeper into your vision - what's the main problem your product solves, and how do you envision it making a difference for your users?",
    userResponses: [
      "The main problem is that people want to be environmentally conscious but don't know how to track their impact or find better alternatives. I envision EcoTrack helping users understand their carbon footprint and making it easy to find eco-friendly products.",
      "I want users to be able to scan products and get instant carbon footprint data, plus recommendations for greener alternatives.",
      "The app should have a social aspect where users can share their progress and challenge friends to be more eco-friendly.",
      "I'm thinking gamification elements like earning points for eco-friendly choices and unlocking achievements."
    ],
    aiResponses: [
      "Excellent! I can see EcoTrack has real potential to make environmental consciousness more accessible and engaging. The carbon footprint tracking combined with product scanning is a powerful combination. Let me understand more about your target users - are you primarily targeting college students, or do you see this appealing to a broader demographic?",
      "Perfect! The social and gamification elements will definitely increase user engagement and retention. For the product scanning feature, are you thinking of using barcode scanning, or would you prefer image recognition for more detailed analysis?",
      "That's a great approach! The social challenges feature could be a key differentiator. How do you envision users discovering and joining these challenges? Through the app directly, or would you want integration with social media platforms?",
      "Excellent! I have a clear picture of EcoTrack now. Based on our discussion, I can see this is a comprehensive mobile application with significant potential. The combination of tracking, recommendations, social features, and gamification creates a compelling user experience. Are you ready to proceed with the technical consultation for full app development?"
