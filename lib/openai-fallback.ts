    "Perfect! I'm getting a clear picture of your project. Let me ask - what's your biggest concern about launching this product?",
    "That makes total sense! I can already see how we can structure this. What would success look like for you in the first month after launch?",
    "Great question! For the technical architecture, are you thinking of a web app, mobile app, or both? This will help me recommend the best technology stack.",
    "Excellent! What about your target users - are they primarily tech-savvy individuals, or do you need to design for a broader audience?",
    "Perfect! I'm getting a comprehensive understanding of your vision. What's your timeline for getting this to market?",

    "Perfect! What about real-time features? Do you need live updates, notifications, or real-time collaboration?",
    "Great! For the payment system, what payment methods do you want to support? Credit cards, PayPal, or cryptocurrency?",
    "Excellent! What about the user interface? Do you have specific design preferences or should we create a modern, intuitive design?",
    "Perfect! One last question - what's your target timeline for the full application? This will help us plan the development phases.",
    "That's a solid foundation! What about scalability - how many users are you expecting in the first year?",
    "Great thinking! What about data security and privacy - are there any specific compliance requirements we need to consider?"
